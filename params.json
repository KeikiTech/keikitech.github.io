Before I moved to Hawai’i I was an Assistant Director at a Montessori kindergarten in South Korea. I look forward to an old age surrounded by the things our students will build.\r\n\r\n### Theodore DeRego\r\nI’m a Junior in the UHH Computer Science program, and I love to code. Most of my experience is from game development as a hobby in high school, but now I mostly develop Bioinformatics software at PBARC (which sounds a lot fancier than it really is). Software development can be a fun hobby and is a great career path since it’s a growing industry, so I think all kids who are interested in the nuts and bolts of computers should have the opportunity to learn.\r\n\r\n### Mike Purvis\r\nI graduated from UH Hilo and like to keep active the growing tech community on Big Island.\r\nWe’ve got some great Meetup groups forming in the Hilo area, and I volunteer with Hawaii Techworks as well.\r\n\r\nIt’s a great time to learn programming, and would love to help kids learn in a fun manner.\r\n\r\nI live in Hilo, working for an Oahu company, Upspring Media. We do a lot of Drupal websites and general web/app development.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-53784915-7","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
